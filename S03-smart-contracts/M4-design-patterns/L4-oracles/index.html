    <h1 id="oracles">Oracles</h1>
<p>In our discussion blockchain primitives, we discussed how public blockchain networks coordinate these powerful tools to create a network state that can be established and maintained by network participants.</p>
<p>However, that network state only holds true within the boundaries of the network itself. We can only guarantee the state transitions of the network participants running our blockchain client software. What about data that exists outside this network, specifically what about "real world" data, such as weather reports, incident details or stock prices? Such data exists but they are beyond the <em>trust boundary</em> established by our blockchain protocols.</p>
<p>One way blockchain developers have tried to bridge the gap is through what are called <strong>off-chain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_oracle" target="_blank">oracles.</a></strong> Off-chain oracles are agents that find and verify real-world information and submit them to the blockchain to be used by smart contracts. They can trigger smart contract executions when the data is obtained or predefined conditions are meet (e.g. time, weather, tracking, payments). Off-chain oracles are provided by organizations like <a href="https://provable.xyz/" target="_blank">Provable Things,</a> <a href="https://chain.link/" target="_blank">Chainlink Labs,</a> and more.</p>
<p>Please note that DeFi has led to on-chain oracles, particularly dealing with token prices, which we will discuss more in the section on DeFi. Such examples of on-chain oracles are Uniswap's <code>[Observations](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/oracle){target=_blank}</code> and MakerDAO's <a href="https://developer.makerdao.com/feeds/" target="_blank">Feeds</a></p>
<h2 id="trust">Trust</h2>
<p>It's extremely important to understand oracles like the ones we're discussing here require trust and they should only be used when the information isn't available in the blockchain. They should be used only when necessary and only from sources you understand. When using oracles, it's important to build in smart contract mechanisms that can anticipate errors or possible corruption. Oracles can succumb to many attack vectors.</p>
<p>Services such as Chainlink have built more decentralized networks to hedge against the centralization of trust, you can read more about how Chainlink does that <a href="https://docs.chain.link/docs/architecture-decentralized-model/" target="_blank">here</a> and see an overview of decentralized oracles <a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/decentralised-oracles-a-comprehensive-overview-d3168b9a8841" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<h2 id="basic-oracle-mechanism">Basic Oracle Mechanism</h2>
<p>At its most basic, a smart contract contract using an oracle needs to implement a method to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the request to the oracle, and</li>
<li>Receive the oracle's response from a callback method</li>
</ol>
<p>Unless you've setup the service yourself, external calls to oracles typically require a fee attached to provide the data to your contract.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to achieve this, let's look at one generalized code using <a href="https://docs.provable.xyz">Provable</a> below:</p>
<pre>import "github.com/oraclize/ethereum-api/provableAPI.sol";

contract DieselPrice is usingProvable {
    uint DieselPriceUSD;

    constructor() public {
        provable_query("URL", "xml(https://www.fueleconomy.gov/ws/rest/fuelprices).fuelPrices.diesel");
    }

    function __callback (bytes32 myid, string result) public {
        require(msg.sender == provable_cbAddress());
        DieselPriceUSD = parseInt(result);
    }
}
      </pre>

<p>In this code, we're calling the Provable API for the price of diesel when we create the contract. The first query is free, but we'll have to provide ETH to pay for our requests moving forward. The call triggers an event, which lets the Provable contract pull from its off-chain datafeed and provide our contract the result. The contract stores that value in <code>DieselPriceUSD</code>.</p>
<p>The overall model is for your contract to emit an event, either to another contract or simply in the block its created. The oracle service will detect that event, pull the desired data, and respond back to your contract. The oracle services require you to have a standard method, like <code>__callback</code>, that its transaction can target when responding to your oracle query.</p>
<p>The oracle ecosystem is growing as fast as blockchain, and we'll touch on it more later in the course. For now, it's important to see how oracles allow us to cross the "trust boundary" of blockchains, what trust assumptions that requires, and the basic design pattern for incorporating this data stream.</p>
